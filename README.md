#  Welcome to the world of Your Favourite & Fresh Food
# "India's most loved Food app [Foodie](https://foddiiee.netlify.app/)"
Developed a dynamic food delivery app using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, applying hooks and react routing to streamline the ordering process and enhance user experience. Implemented efficient cart functionality with Redux. Ensured application reliability and stability through unit testing using jest

Used swiggy apis for restaurant data (as swiggy keeps on updating their apis, I have updated the code to use mock data)

[Foodie App](https://foddiiee.netlify.app/) from scratch using React.js.
